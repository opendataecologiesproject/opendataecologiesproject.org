<h1>The Open Data Ecologies Project</h1>
<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 20px">September 19, 2014. San Francisco, California, USA <a class="permalink" href="/blog/2014-09-19-1">permalink</a></p>

<p class="lead">Today I am happy to announce the Open Data Ecologies Project which sets out to connect, document, and support open data communities around the world.

<p>This is the very initial form of an organic, research- and practice-oriented investigation of Open Data, Open Government, and Civic Technology as it exists in various local contexts. Governments around the world have turned to open data and concepts of open governance to advance development goals, increase trust in public institutions through transparency, and enable new data-driven insights. Citizens have embraced civic technology as a new way of contributing to their societies and participating in the co-creation of public infrastructure.

<p>As these efforts have spread to countries on every continent and governments at every level, information flow has proved a challenge. Success stories travel quickly, but negative results are rarely published and many efforts are duplicated. To realize the full potential of open data and civic technology, we need to better understand the flow of information, stories, and processes between people, organizations, and communities.

<p>Through a lens of networked ecology, this project will advance human knowledge of how to better use information and telecommunications technologies to improve human well-being, strengthen democratic and participatory institutions, and tackle complex dillemas in a just and informed manner.

<h2>Inspiration</h2>

<p>In 2014, I experienced the birth of an open data ecosystem in Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA, where I worked as a Code for America fellow. I helped shape and consult on government policy, provide technical advice on the open data portal and technical data standards, and witnessed a community form around using open data to build projects and applications. My colleagues and I began thinking about what we were seeing in terms of an open data ecosystem, comprised of various pieces in an interconnected whole.

<p>Without the policy, the open data portal would have languished without data. Without the community of data consumers, the data portal would have sat unutilized. And without the portal, the policy would have been impotent for lack of technical infrastructure. No doubt many other nodes contribute to the open data ecosystem in Chattanooga: key partners like the public library, individuals like the mayor and open data specialists, and a host of partners in government agencies, private vendors, and community foundations. Understanding the web of connections between these entities can help explain how the environment and culture of open data in Chattanooga came to be. It also can provide a blue print or a game plan for people hoping to replicate it in other areas.

<p>Is the particular blend of elements in Chattanooga unique? Are there certain key ingredients in making an open data partnership work? What approaches and combinations have been tried in other cities in the US? In other places in the world? These are questions this project hopes to answer.

<p>The field of open data is crowded with people and organizations, each with their own rhetoric, interests, alliances, and funding models. From academic researchers and non-profits to government agencies, non-governmental organizations and for-profit corporations - multinational development organizations like the World Bank, the administration of US President Barack Obama, companies like Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, and ESRI, advocacy groups like the Open Knowledge Foundation, Sunlight Labs, the American Civil Liberties Union, Code for America, and local researchers, city administrations, real estate developers, and citizen groups: everyone involved in open data and civic technology has a stake - and a role - in the development and maturement of this global network of open data ecosystems.

<p>Through documenting the connections in this network and connecting people across geographic regions, we can improve the practice and outcomes of open data and civic technology efforts.

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>Starting in the fall of 2014, I am starting a series of field research trips to areas of the world with thriving open data ecosystems. These destinations have been chosen on an opportunistic, non-scientific basis. The first of these trips is at the end of September to Mexico City, Mexico to participate in Con Datos, a Latin American open data conference. While there, I hope to visit the Lab Para La Ciudad, an active locus of urban and technological experimentation situated within the municipal government of Mexico City. Mexico also recently launched datos.gob.mx, their national data portal. I will talk to people who developed policy, technology, and organizations supporting open data in Mexico and document how it all played out.

<p>Near future trips will include London, Berlin, and Reykjavik, Iceland. Others involved in the project will add other cities and experiences to our body of research.

<p>In addition to documentation trips, the Open Data Ecologies Project will be developing tools for documenting and exploring the data we collect. Naturally, all of the data and tooling produced by the project will be free and open source under minimally restrictive licensing terms. The tools will allow anyone to document and analyze the ecology of their own local open data ecosystem, and contribute that knowledge back to the global database.

<p>If you are interested in conducting or contributing original research, the Open Data Ecologies Project can support you with access to tools, research participants, pre-press technical assistance, and open-access publication. We can provide assistance developing a project prospectus and finding potential research grants.

<p>If you are an open data or civic technology practictioner, you can help contribute to research by sharing your knowledge and stories. We can share your experiences with a wider audience of researchers, fellow practitioners, publishers, and journalists.

<p>If you are interested in funding research, there are a variety of ways to get involved. The priority funding areas for the project are travel and lodging grants for field investigators to document emerging practice communities and open data ecosystems worldwide. If you have particicular research questions or areas of focus, we are happy to discuss how our unique researchers, tooling, and relationship network can help advance your goals.
